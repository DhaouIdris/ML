# ðŸ§ª HoloTrack â€” 3D Reconstruction of Bacteria using Holography and Deep Learning

This project investigates the use of deep learning for the **3D volumetric reconstruction of bacteria** from a **single 2D hologram**, leveraging numerical holography and physics-informed neural networks.

---

## ðŸ“Œ Objective

The goal is to develop a machine learning pipeline that:

- Predicts the **presence and 3D location** of particles (e.g., bacteria) from a raw hologram.
- Integrates the **physics of diffraction** into the learning process.
- Uses **synthetic data** to train a model robust to optical variability and noise.
